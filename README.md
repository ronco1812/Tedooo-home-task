● Build a backend application(in any technology that you like) that will read an XML file
and provide an API that returns feed items that return the relevant data for the client.

● You can find the XML here: https://dev.tedooo.com/feed.xml

● Build a web application (in React) that will call the Feed API and render the data
according to the response.
○ The API will return only 6 feed items every call
○ When the user scrolls to the end of the page the application will call the API and
render the next 6 feed items
○ Please render only the 2 first images per feed item(if they exist)
○ Bonus - The application will fire an impression on every feed item that the user
watch
